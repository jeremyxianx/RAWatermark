# Contributing to RAWatermark


We welcome contributions from experts, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix to either codes or documentations
- Adding new documentations under /docs/
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

To ensure the project remains manageable and consistent, please follow these guidelines:

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/yourname/yourproject/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourname/yourproject/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
